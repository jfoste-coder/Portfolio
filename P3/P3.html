	  </p>
	  <ol>
      <li>Define a concrete class named <code>TicTacToe</code> for modeling a simple tic-tac-toe board. It will have utility methods for
      checking if a game board is a win or a loss for either player (or a draw), determining what possible next moves are available for
      either player, and for displaying the board for visual debugging.</li>
		  <li>Define an abstract class named <code>Player</code> for modeling tic-tac-toe players. It should define one abstract method for
      choosing a single move for a given game board (which will be overridden by its sub-classes), and one concrete method for computing the
      value of a given board for this player (based on whether it is a winning or losing board).</li>
		  <li>Define two concrete sub-classes named <code>UserPlayer</code> and <code>AIPlayer</code> which extend <code>Player</code> and
      and provide different implementations of the appropriate methods. <code>AIPlayer</code> will use recursion to choose the optimal next
      move.</li>
      <li>Prepare the assignment for submission and submit it through Gradescope.</li>

	  <span class="section">TicTacToe</span> 
    </p><p>
      The game known as tic-tac-toe is a simple board game played with two players which alternate filling in spaces on an initially blank
      3-by-3 board. One player uses the symbol "X" as their mark, and the other player uses the symbol "O". The first player that can make 
      three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If the entire board is filled without either player 
      winning, the game is a draw. The <code>TicTacToe</code> class we are about to write will model the game board itself, and several useful
      methods for interacting with the board.
<!--       The term "robot" (at least in popular usage) can refer to a very broad category of things, and yet there is a common image that we often have in mind when discussing robots in general: machines that interact with the world. Usually, we categorize different types of robots based on their capabilities. Let's create a general class that identifies some common capabilities that different robots might have, with the possibility that new capabilities might be added in the future. The <code>Robot</code> class we are about to write will be a general class which we can use to describe any type of robot - we won't worry about the specifics yet, and instead we'll use subclasses to describe those. -->
    </p><p>
      Our <code>TicTacToe</code> class will include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A private field, <code>board</code>, which is a 2D <code>char</code> array with three rows and three columns.</li>
      <li>Two private fields, <code>x</code> and <code>o</code>, which are references to <code>Player</code> subclasses. (Note: the names of these fields are lower case, following Java variable naming convention).</li>
      <li>Getters and setters for all fields.</li>
      <li>A constructor which takes two <code>Player</code> arguments. The first argument should be the player for the "X" symbol, and the 
        second the player for the "O" symbol. This constructor should also initialize the <code>board</code> to <code>'_'</code> (the 
        underscore character) for each space.</li>
      <li>A public method named <code>countBlanks</code> which takes no arguments and returns the number of spaces on the board which are blank (the underscore character) as an <code>int</code>.</li>
      <li>A public method named <code>markerForPlayer</code> which takes a single <code>Player</code> argument and returns the character 
        representing that player's symbol (either <code>'X'</code> or <code>'O'</code> (note these are UPPER case characters)). The situation where the argument is not either the "X" or "O" player will not be tested.</li>
      <li>A public method named <code>checkWin</code> which takes a single <code>Player</code> argument and returns <code>true</code> if the
        given player is the winner of this board (has three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and 
        <code>false</code> otherwise.</li>
      <li>A public method named <code>checkLose</code> which takes a single <code>Player</code> argument and returns <code>true</code> if the
        <emph>other</emph> player is the winner of this board and <code>false</code> otherwise. Note that neither player may be the winner of 
        a given board, either because the game is not over, or because the game is a draw.</li>
      <li>A public method named <code>checkDraw</code> which takes no arguments and returns <code>true</code> if the current board is a draw
        (no blank spaces and no winner), and <code>false</code> otherwise.</li>
      <li>An overridden <code>toString</code> method which represents the current board as a single <code>String</code> suitable for printing.
        The <code>String</code> should contain each character of the board in row-column order with newlines between rows. For example the 
        board <code>{{'O','_','X'},{'_','X','_'},{'_','_','_'}}</code> should be represented as the <code>String</code> 
        <code>"O_X\n_X_\n___\n"</code> which, when printed, should display as
        <code>
        <table>
          <tr><td>O</td><td>_</td><td>X</td></tr>
          <tr><td>_</td><td>X</td><td>_</td></tr>
          <tr><td>_</td><td>_</td><td>_</td></tr>
        </table>
        </code></li>
      <li>A public method named <code>possibleMoves</code> which takes a single <code>Player</code> argument and returns a new array of 
        <code>TicTacToe</code> boards representing the possible next moves for the given player. Note that the given player may place
        their mark on any of the spaces on the board that are currently blank. <b><u>Important note 1</u></b>: the <b>order</b> that the
        possible moves should be returned in is important, and should be in row-column order. <b><u>Important note 2</u></b>: this method 
        <b><u>should not</u></b> modify the current board, the returned <code>TicTacToe</code> instances should make a deep copy of the current 
        board's configuration, with one of the blank spaces filled in.</li>
    </ul>
<hr>
  <p>
  	<span class="section">Player Class</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  	Since we will have two different kinds of players (human and AI), the <code>Player</code> class will be an <code>abstract</code> class which
    both sub-classes will extend. This class only has two components:
  </p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>A public method named <code>chooseMove</code> which takes a single <code>TicTacToe</code> argument and returns one of the 
        <code>possibleMove</code>s. How this move is chosen will depend on the kind of player, so this must be an abstract method which 
        subclasses must override.</li>
  		<li>A public method named <code>boardValue</code> which takes a single <code>TicTacToe</code> argument and returns a <code>double</code> 
        value representing how good the given board is for this player. The default implementation for this method should be to return 
        <code>1.0</code> if this player has won this board, <code>-1.0</code> if this player has lost this board, and <code>0.0</code> 
        otherwise (see <code>checkWin</code> and <code>checkLose</code> in the <code>TicTacToe</code> class). Since 
        this default implementation is common to all subclasses, this should <b>not</b> be an abstract method.</li>
  	</ul>
  </li>
<hr>
  <p>
  <span class="section">UserPlayer Class</span> 
  </p>
  <p>
    The first kind of <code>Player</code> subclass we'll create will allow a user to interact with the game board at the terminal. This
    should help us debug the various features of the other classes, and if the above classes are complete, allow us to play a game of
    tic-tac-toe using the provided <code>PVPGame</code> class. The <code>UserPlayer</code> class has the following features:
  </p>
  <ul>
  	<li>It should extend the <code>Player</code> class.</li>
    <li>It should have one private <code>String</code> object with the name <code>name</code>.</li>
  	<li>It should have one private <code>Scanner</code> object with the name <code>input</code>.</li>
    <li>It should have one public constructor that takes one <code>Scanner</code> and one <code>String</code> as arguments as initial values for
      these two fields.</li>
    <li>It should override the <code>toString</code> method to return the <code>name</code> field.</li>
    <li>It should override the <code>chooseMove</code> method to do the following:
      <ol>
        <li>Print out the current board that was passed in as an argument.</li>
        <li>Use the <code>possibleMoves</code> method of the argument to get the options the user can choose from and print them out.</li>
        <li>Ask the user to select one of these options and get the user's response using the <code>Scanner</code> object.</li>
        <li>Return the <code>TicTacToe</code> board selected by the user.</li>
      </ol>
      The particular format of the strings printed to the user is not important, and will not be tested, but to aid your own debugging you
      should use the <code>toString</code> methods of the <code>TicTacToe</code> class, provide clear separation between the current board 
      and the possible options, and indicate which array index corresponds with each board option. Validation of user input will also not be
      tested, so you can assume the user will always enter a valid option.
    </li>
  </ul>
<hr>
  <p>
  	<span class="section">AIPlayer Class</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  	With simple games, there are techniques for developing AI players which perform very well. For general games this can be a very challenging 
    task to accomplish efficiently, but for very simple games like tic-tac-toe even a simple recursive solution is efficient enough. This class
    will model this recursive solution. The <code>AIPlayer</code> class includes the following components:
  </p>
  <ul>
  	<li>It should extend the <code>Player</code> class.</li>
    <li>It should have one private <code>String</code> object with the name <code>name</code>.</li>
    <li>It should have one private <code>Player</code> object with the name <code>opponent</code>.</li>
    <li>It should have a getter and setter for the <code>opponent</code> field.</li>
    <li>It should override the <code>toString</code> method to return the <code>name</code> field concatenated with the string 
      <code>" (AI)"</code> (so if the <code>name</code> field was <code>"Player 1"</code> the return value should be 
      <code>"Player 1 (AI)"</code>)</li>
    <li>It should have one public constructor that takes one <code>String</code> and one <code>Player</code> as arguments as initial values for
      these two fields.</li>
    <li>It should have two mutually recursive methods, <code>minValue</code> and <code>maxValue</code> which work in the following way:
      <ul>
        <li>Both methods are public, take a <code>TicTacToe</code> instance as their single argument, and return a <code>double</code> 
          value.</li>
        <li>
          The base cases for both methods are the same: if the argument represents a tic-tac-toe game where this <code>AIPlayer</code> has won 
          the game the value is <code>1.0</code>. If the argument is a game where this player has lost the game the value is 
          <code>-1.0</code>. If the argument is a draw game, the value is <code>0.0</code>. If no one has won and the game is not a draw, the
          value of the board must be computed recursively.
        </li>
        <li>The recursive cases are similar to each other, but slightly different. The <code>maxValue</code> method is used to determine what
          value this player could get by choosing optimally among the options provided by <code>possibleMoves</code> for the current game board.
          In order to compute this, the <b>AIPlayer</b> assumes that its <b>opponent</b> is going to try and choose the move option on the next 
          board which <b>minimizes</b> its return. Therefore, <code>maxValue</code> should compute the <code>minValue</code> of each of the
          possible moves for <b>this player</b>, and then choose the option with the <b>highest</b> value.
        </li>
        <li>Similarly, the recursive case for the <code>minValue</code> method looks at the <code>possibleMoves</code> for the <b>opponent</b>, 
          computes the <code>maxValue</code> of each option, and returns the value of the option which is <b>lowest</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>With the above two recursive methods completed, the <code>AIPlayer</code> can now override the <code>chooseMove</code> method. 
      This method should get all of the <code>possibleMoves</code> for the given board, calculate each of the possible moves' 
      <code>minValue</code>, and then return the move with the <b>highest</b> value.</li>
    <li>Since the <code>AIPlayer</code> has a mechanism for computing the value of a game board that is more sophisticated than the default
      provided in <code>Player</code>, we should override the <code>boardValue</code> method as well, so that it returns the 
      <code>maxValue</code> of the given board. This might be helpful when debugging your recursive implementations. For example, consider the 
      following board:

        <code>
        <table>
          <tr><td>O</td><td>_</td><td>X</td></tr>
          <tr><td>_</td><td>X</td><td>_</td></tr>
          <tr><td>_</td><td>O</td><td>X</td></tr>
        </table>
        </code>
        The current player in this situation is "O", but regardless of which option they choose, the "X" player can win on the next turn.
        Therefore, even though though this board isn't complete yet, the <code>boardValue</code> for the "X" player should be 
        <code>1.0</code> (and <code>-1.0</code> for the "O" player). It can be helpful when debugging your recursive solution to construct
        several different boards that are one, two, or three moves away from a winning/losing or draw board, and then trace the recursion
        step by step.
  </ul>

  	<span class="section">PVPGame and VSComputer classes</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Both of these classes are complete as provided. If all your other classes are implemented correctly, you should be able to compile and run
    either class to play a game of tic-tac-toe. You may modify these classes as you wish, but you should make sure that in your final submission
    your code compiles and runs correctly with the original contents. You do not need to include <code>PVPGame.java</code> or 
    <code>VSComputer.java</code> in your submission (and your submission should compile cleanly if these files are missing).
  </p>

<hr>
  <p>
  <span class="section">Testing:</span>
	  <p>
	  There are two completly implemented classes which are provided to you for testing your code:
      </p><ul>
        <li>PVPGame.java</li>	  
        <li>VSComputer.java</li>
	  </ul>
    Both classes create instances of the <code>TicTacToe</code> and <code>UserPlayer</code> classes, and use them to play a game of tic-tac-toe
    with a user on the command line. The <code>PVPGame</code> class creates two <code>UserPlayer</code>'s, and can be used to quickly verify
    that the basic game functionality works correctly. The <code>VSComputer</code> class creates one <code>UserPlayer</code> and one <code>
    AIPlayer</code> so that you can test your tic-tac-toe skills against a difficult opponent. If you have implemented everything correctly, 
    the <code>AIPlayer</code> should never lose, and should win if the <code>UserPlayer</code> makes mistakes! In order to compile these two 
    classes, you must have created all of the appropriate <code>.java</code> files, and much of the API must be correct. Most logic errors 
    should be clear when running these classes, however you should still write your own tests to verify the correctness of your code. You do not
    need to use the junit framework (or jar file) to compile these two classes, but you should use unit testing for your own tests.
